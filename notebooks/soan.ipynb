    "**Goal**  \n",
    "On 17 August 2018,I married the woman of my dreams. In order to know just how special she was (and is) to me I decided to put my data science skills to work. I analysed whatsapp data and all of our pictures that we made together. The end product was a small book that included results of this notebook with descriptions of all analyses that were done. I gave it to her the day before we married as to show what she means to me. \n",

    "**Project**  \n",
    "The project started off with basic data analyses, namely getting means and sums of different statistics such as average number of words per message per user and eventually evolved into analyzing topics that were frequently discussed in the group chat. Personally, the most interesting analysis I have done in this project was using TF-IDF as a way to extract words that characterize each person in the group chat. It is interesting to see which words are often used by one person, but rarely by all others. \n",
